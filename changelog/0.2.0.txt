* Version
  - 0.2.0
  - Release Date: <2021-06-30 Wed>

* Changes
- This release contains *significant breaking changes*
  + The API has been simplified to only the following functions in
    core (below). Also, key and value parsing is only available where
    needed:
    - ~get~
    - ~set~
    - ~clear~
    - ~get-range~
    - ~clear-range~
  + The ~*-subspaced-*~ functions are no longer available, the
    functionality is folded into the core API (listed above)
  + ~byte-streams~ support has been removed from the library.
    Serialization / De-serialization is supported for data-structures
    that FDB provides (Tuple, Subspace, Directory). (You are of course
    free to use ~byte-streams~ or any other serialization library in
    the application code)
- This library now depends on the latest java driver available.
  (~6.3.13~)
- Full Subspace and DirectoryLayer support is now available and baked
  into the core API.
- Should you need it, the full underlying Java API is available to
  you.
- The following functionality will be added in upcoming releases:
  + Leveraging the power of Clojure for FDB async operations
  + Full support for FDB watches
  + Support for versionstamps
- This library is still in the 0.x stage. I expect new releases to
  have breakage in API until I get to the 1.0.0 release, post which
  the API will be permanently supported.
