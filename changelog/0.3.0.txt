* Version
  - 0.3.0
  - Release Date: <2021-07-25 Sun>

* Changes
- This release contains *significant breaking changes*
- The API now supports Clojure vectors as Tuples and Subspaces (they
  are converted internally). This makes the library much more
  intuitive to use and my recommendation is to always use Subspaces +
  Tuples for keys and where possible use Tuples for values in FDB.
- ~encode~ and ~decode~ functions have been removed from the core API.
  When using vectors, they are unnecessary.
- Support for top-level ~keyfn~ and ~valfn~ arguments has been moved
  to an ~opts~ map, which will support more options in the future.
- The behavior of ~keyfn~ / ~valfn~ has changed and become more
  intuitive. Refer to examples in the README to understand how to use
  these functions.
- ~parsefn~ has been renamed to ~valfn~ for consistency
- MutationType and ~mutate~ support is now available and baked into
  the core API. (Check out docs for ~fc/mutate!~ and it's usage in
  ~farstar~)
- The following functionality will be added in upcoming releases:
  + Leveraging the power of Clojure for FDB async operations
  + Full support for FDB watches
  + Support for versionstamps
- This library is still in the 0.x stage. I expect new releases to
  have breakage in API until I get to the 1.0.0 release, post which
  the API will be permanently supported.
