# clj-fdb

A thin wrapper for the Java API for FoundationDB.

## Installation

Currently, installing this library is broken. This is because the FoundationDB Java API Jar is not available for download from a central repository like Maven.

## Examples

You can find the Class Scheduler example detailed in the FoundationDB docs converted to Clojure in the `examples/` folder. This gives the reader a good idea of how to use `clj-fdb`
